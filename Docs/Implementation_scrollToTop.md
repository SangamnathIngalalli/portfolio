# Feature: Scroll to Top Button

## Purpose
Improve usability and navigation for long-scroll pages by providing a convenient way for users to quickly return to the top of the screen. This enhances both accessibility and user experience, especially on mobile and content-heavy views.

## Functional Requirements
- A floating "Back to Top" button should appear once the user scrolls down more than 200px.
- The button must be fixed in the bottom-right corner of the viewport.
- On click, the page should smoothly scroll back to the top.
- The button should disappear when the user is near the top of the page.

## Design & Styling
- Button shape: circular or pill-shaped with an upward arrow icon.
- Size: ~48x48px (touch-friendly).
- Location: bottom-right, with margin (e.g. `bottom: 2rem; right: 2rem;`).
- Colors, shadows, and hover effects must comply with the design system (see `Docs/UI_UX_doc.md`).
- Responsive: Must not obstruct key UI elements on mobile.

## Accessibility
- Must be keyboard focusable (`tabindex="0"`).
- Include an ARIA label such as `aria-label="Scroll to top"`.
- Ensure it is screen reader compatible.
- Sufficient color contrast for visibility.

## Integration
- Component should live in a shared UI or layout directory (e.g., `components/BackToTopButton.tsx`).
- Mount the component globally inside the root layout file (e.g., `AppLayout.tsx`, `PageShell.tsx`, or equivalent).
- Visibility should be controlled via scroll event listener (`window.addEventListener('scroll', ...)`).

## Implementation Notes
- Use `window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })` for smooth scroll behavior.
- Throttle or debounce scroll listener for performance.
- Use `useEffect` in React for mounting/unmounting the scroll event.
- Optional: Animate fade-in/out using CSS transitions or a motion library.

## Testing Strategy
- ✅ Verify button appears after scrolling down.
- ✅ Confirm smooth scroll-to-top functionality on click.
- ✅ Test appearance and behavior across screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- ✅ Ensure screen readers can detect and describe the button.
- ✅ Validate keyboard operability (arrow/tab key navigation).

## Dependencies
- `Docs/UI_UX_doc.md` – for design standards and spacing
- `Docs/context.md` – to ensure it aligns with page structure logic
- Layout file where global components are placed
- (Optional) Utility hooks (e.g., `useScrollPosition` or debounce helpers)
