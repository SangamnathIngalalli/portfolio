|-----|------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 5   | 2024-06-28 | Back to Top Button | Fixed visibility so button only appears after scrolling 200px | css/style.css, js/main.js |
| 6   | 2024-06-28 | Back to Top Button | Second fix attempt: Button was still visible at top; logic updated to ensure it only appears after scrolling 200px | js/main.js |
| 7   | 2024-06-28 | Back to Top Button | Third fix attempt: Button still visible at top; logic updated again to ensure it only appears after scrolling 200px | js/main.js |
| 8   | 2024-06-28 | Back to Top Button | Fourth fix attempt: Button still visible at top; logic updated again to ensure it only appears after scrolling 200px | js/main.js |
| 9   | 2024-07-01 | Back to Top Button | Fifth fix attempt: Added explicit display style manipulation to ensure button is completely hidden when at the top of the page and removed conflicting CSS rule that was making the button visible by default | js/main.js, css/style.css |
| 10  | 2024-07-01 | Back to Top Button | Sixth fix attempt: Fixed scroll to top functionality by using modern scrollTo API with smooth behavior and added CSS class for visible state | js/main.js, css/style.css |
| 11  | 2024-12-19 | Back to Top Button | Seventh fix attempt: Simplified implementation by removing complex data-scroll CSS selectors and inline style manipulation, using only CSS classes for visibility control | js/main.js, css/style.css |
| 12  | 2024-12-19 | Back to Top Button | Eighth fix attempt: Identified and removed scroll prevention script in HTML that was forcing page to top and preventing normal scrolling, which was blocking the back-to-top button functionality | index.html |
| 13  | 2024-12-19 | Back to Top Button | Ninth fix attempt: Added missing CSS variables (`--glossy-bg`, `--card-bg`, etc.) that were causing CSS to fail, and added debugging to troubleshoot visibility issues | css/style.css, js/main.js |
| 14  | 2024-12-19 | Page Refresh | **NEW ISSUE**: Page refreshes showing content from below instead of top; Fixed by adding script to ensure page starts at top when refreshed | index.html |
| 15  | 2024-12-19 | Back to Top Button | Tenth fix attempt: Button appearing on first page but disappearing when scrolling; Fixed by ensuring button is hidden initially and only shows when scrolling past 200px | js/main.js |
| 16  | 2024-12-19 | Page Loading | Eleventh fix attempt: Page starting from 2nd page after loading; Fixed by adding immediate scroll-to-top script in head section and multiple event listeners | index.html |
| 17  | 2024-12-19 | Back to Top Button | Twelfth fix attempt: Button disappeared due to duplicate HTML elements; Removed duplicate back-to-top button and added enhanced debugging with CSS !important rules | index.html, css/style.css, js/main.js |
| 18  | 2024-12-19 | Back to Top Button | **FINAL SIMPLIFIED FIX**: Completely rewrote implementation using direct style manipulation instead of CSS classes, removed all complexity, and simplified scroll-to-top script | js/main.js, css/style.css, index.html |
| 19  | 2024-12-19 | Back to Top Button | **BULLETPROOF FIX**: Moved button implementation to main.js with robust error handling, changed button ID to avoid conflicts, added comprehensive CSS with !important rules, and implemented multiple fallback mechanisms for visibility control | js/main.js, css/style.css, index.html |
